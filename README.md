Given two string arrays word1 and word2, return true if the two arrays represent the same string, and false otherwise.

A string is represented by an array if the array elements concatenated in order forms the string.

The completed version of this code can be copied into a Java file and fully executed from the user's terminal, however, it must be noted that the arrays that hold the input strings have a max size of 100. To change this, please go to the lines where the string arrays are initialized in "main" and change 100 to whatever number is necessary.
